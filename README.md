> This is the final project for Ruby on Rails Microverse's Module: a Twitter Clone.

# TweetHub
Features on this project:

1. After creating an account, a user can log in to the app only by typing the username and password.
2. The user is presented with the homepage that includes:
    1. Left-side menu with current user information and main navigation.
    2. All *Tweets/Opinions* in the center of the screen, as the main content.
    3. Right-side section with *Who to follow*.
    4. More information about a user when clicking on its profile.
3. The *Tweets* section includes:
    1. Simple form for creating a tweet.
    2. List of all tweets (sorted by most recent) that display tweet text and author details.
4. The *Who to follow* section includes:
    1. List of profiles that are not followed by the logged-in user (ordered by most recently added).
5. When the user opens the profile page, they can see:
    1. Left-side menu.
    2. Cover picture and *Tweets* tab in the center.
    3. Right-side section with *Profile detailed info.*
6. The *Profile detailed info* section includes:
    1. User photo.
    2. Button to follow a user.
    3. Stats: total number of tweets, number of followers and number of following users.
    4. List of people who follow this user (only if there are any followers).
7. *Additional feature*:
    Users can upload a profile picture and cover image from their computer when signing up or when editing the account. When not uploading in Sign Up, a default profile picture and cover image will show up (the feature still needs improvements with an s3 server since Heroku discards images when refreshing Dinos).
